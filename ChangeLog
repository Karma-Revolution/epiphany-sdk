	* build-toolchain.sh: Add staging directory for things we need for
	building but don't want to include in the SDK.
	Install ncurses to staging area so it doesn't end up in the SDK.
	Skip building and installing things we don't need from ncurses.

2014-10-22  Ola Jeppsson  <ola@adapteva.com>

	* build-toolchain.sh: Don't install programs from ncurses

	* install-sdk.sh: Remove the following flags: -a, --arch, --arm, --x86, -t
	and --toolprfx. --host <arch-triplet> is sufficient now.
	Use uname to figure out buildarch automatically.
	Compare buildarch and hostarch to determine if we're cross-compiling. If we
	are, make sure to set the right PATH so we use the buildarch->targetarch
	compiler (and not hostarch->targetarch compiler).
	Verify that buildarch->targetarch toolchain is present.
	If we're doing Canadian cross, verify that buildarch->hostarch toolchain is
	present.
	* build-epiphany-sdk.sh: Pass hostarch triplet to install-sdk.sh when doing
	Canadian cross compilation.
	* build-toolchain.sh: Use uname to determine buildarch.
	Install newlib for buildarch->targetarch compiler when doing Canadian cross
	compilation. Some header files were missing (e.g. <sys/types.h>).
